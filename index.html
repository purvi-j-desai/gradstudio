<h1>Welcome to the GradStudio Project!</h1>

<p>The GradStudio Project uses peer evaluation to give you quick feedback
for improving your graduate application essays. When you join the
project, you become part of a large, diverse group of participants who
have all agreed to share and give feedback on each others' essays.</p>

<p>The project is open to any interested applicants currently working on
application essays for graduate programs. <b>The deadline for completing
the project is December 1st</b>. After this date, the project will close.</p>

<p>To join the Peer Review Essay Project, you should have a full and
complete draft of your application essay, either a personal statement,
statement of purpose, or a research statement (<a

This does not have to be a final or "polished" essay, but should have a
beginning, middle, and end in order for you to get the most out of the
project. Please be sure you title your essay as either a research
statement or statement of purpose/personal statement so that your
reviewers will know how to give you the best feedback.</p>
