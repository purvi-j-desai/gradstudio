<p>You will need to follow this link to upload your essay, get feedback, give 
feedback to other participants, and re-submit your essay with revisions. </p>
<p>When you get there, click <b>'Create/Edit Your Draft'</b>. The first time you do 
this you will need to create a Peerstudio account:</p>
<ol><li>Click <b>'I have a password'</b> underneath the '1-click sign-in' buttons 
that appear.</li>
<li>Click 'Sign Up' at the bottom of the form that appears.</li>
<li>Fill in the form to create your Peerstudio account. Remember your password, 
as you will need it to log back in to Peerstudio in the future.</li></ol>
<p>Once you complete this, you will be logged in and taken to the assignment 
page. There, you will be able to upload your essay for peer review.</p>
<p>Because the GradStudio Project is not an online course, your assignment will 
not be visible on the “Course” homepage for Peerstudio if you login to Peerstudio 
directly. It is important that you <b>follow your unique assignment link, 
above.</b> </p>
<p>Happy Writing! </p>
