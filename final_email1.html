<p>Hello from the GradStudio Project!</p>
<p>This is a quick reminder that today is the last day to fill out our <b>End Survey</b>. It is quite short
and will only take a couple minutes to fill out, and your responses will be very helpful for our
research! It also gives you a chance to share any comments you may have on your experience with
GradStudio and how it could be improved in the future.</p>
<p>And if that's not incentive enough, as a thank you for your participation, we will be inviting a
randomly-selected group of people who complete the End Survey to submit an essay for <b>free, in-depth
editing help and feedback</b> from our team of experienced PhD researchers!</p>
