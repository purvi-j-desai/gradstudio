<p>DESCRIPTION: You are invited to participate in a research study on peer assessment. 
Peer assessment means that you will assess the work of other participants in this project. </p>
<p>If you consent to participating in this study, we will log your interaction with our system, 
such as when you visit the website, and what pages you visit, the kind of feedback you write 
while assessing etc. If you choose, you can also participate in surveys that will help us better 
understand your use of this tool, and improve the system.</p>
<p>You may also complete some surveys related to the project (such as a post-project survey 
on your experience) that you fill out on a different website. If you complete these surveys 
we may correlate your system usage with information on such surveys. </p>
<p>You must be 18 or older to participate in this research study. If you are less than 18, 
you cannot participate in the research study. Please see ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION below.</p> 
<p>The information you provide us will help us create better assessment systems in the future. </p>
<p>RISKS AND BENEFITS: There are no risks associated with this study beyond those encountered 
in daily life.  We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits 
from this study. Your participation will help us improve peer assessment, and hopefully, 
education in the future.</p>
<p>TIME INVOLVEMENT: Typically, you will spend between 15 min and an hour using this system.</p>
<p>PAYMENTS: You will be not be financially compensated for your participation.</p>

<p>DATA RETENTION, SHARING, AND DELETION: This system will record your work, reviews and 
other similar information. We will not share your personally identifying data (such as your 
name and email address) with people outside our research team.</p>
<p>You can ask that we delete your data. To do so, delete your account, or email us. If you 
do, please understand that not all data can be deleted. For instance, if your peers’ grades 
are determined by your assessment, we cannot delete them.  </p>
<p>ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION: You are not required to participate in this study. </p>
<p>SUBJECT'S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this 
project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw

participation in the study at any point for any reason.</p><br/>
