	<p><i>What's the project all about?</i></p>
	
	<p>The GradStudio Project provides a way for students to help each other with their essay
	writing in preparation for graduate applications. Trading essays with others and giving each
	other feedback can be a valuable way to troubleshoot and improve your writing--plus it’s fast,
	easy, and free! <br/>
	The GradStudio Project will not provide expert advice or intensive, in-depth
	critique, but will be a way to get a few helpful “quick checks” of your writing.</p>

	<p><i>What is a statement of purpose/personal statement/research statement?</i></p>
	
	<p>While you should consult your individual graduate program application guidelines 
	for specific instructions, there are many excellent general resources available online 
	to help guide your application essay writing. <br/>
	<a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/969/1/">Example</a><br/>
	<a href="http://career.ucsd.edu/_files/personalstmt.pdf">Professional School Personal Statement</a><br/>
	<a href="http://career.ucsd.edu/_files/statmentofintent.pdf">Academic Statement of Intent</a><br/></p>

    <p><i>I'm not applying to grad school this year, but I’d like to get feedback on an essay for school/work/other. Can I join the project?</i></p>
    
    <p>While we are excited to consider possibilities for expanding this project in the future, we are currently focused entirely on students applying to graduate programs. You must upload an application essay for a graduate program in the project, however personal statements, statements of purpose, <b>and</b> research statements are all welcome.</p>

    <p><i>I want feedback on my personal statement and my research statement. Can I upload more than one essay in this project? 
    </i></p>
    
    <p>No, you may only submit one essay for feedback in this project. In the future we hope to be able to coordinate multiple entries for participants, but at this time we are only accepting one entry per participant.</p>
    
    <p><i>Why am I getting feedback from peers? Why is that helpful?</i></p>

    <p>Peer assessment has been used with great success in massive open online courses where instructors are unable to give individual feedback to massive numbers of students. Research has shown that peer graders give reliable and consistent feedback that compares with grading by instructors.</p>

    <p><i>Who gets to see my essay?</i></p>

	<p>Only the people giving you peer feedback will see your essay. Unfortunately we cannot 
	control how participants may use the materials in the project. All participants in the 
	GradStudio project must agree to abide by our Honor Code. <b>We remind you to never reveal 
	personal information in any material you upload for peer review. You may also replace 
	specific institution names with “school X”</b>, for example instead of “I am applying to UC 
	San Diego Cognitive Science”, say “I am applying to School X Cognitive Science”.</p>

	<p>The information that you submit to us in this project such as your email or other 
	personal information, will never be shared with participants in the project and will 
	be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. </p>

    <p><i>Who is running GradStudio? Why are you doing this?</i></p>

    <p>GradStudio is an open online peer assessment project from <a href="http://pages.ucsd.edu/~cmhicks/Hicks%20website/home.html">Cat Hicks</a>, <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu/">Ailie Fraser</a>, <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~pdesai/">Purvi Desai</a> and <a href="http://d.ucsd.edu/srk/">Scott R. Klemmer</a>. We are researchers in Design, Computer Science and HCI who are passionate about improving access to learning and educational opportunities. The GradStudio Project is a beta test of some of our ideas for how to improve crowdsourced peer feedback for students.</p>
